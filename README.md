Whatsup guys I am new to the programming world. 
The reason I want to begin coding is to make an overview of online data as I wish. I do not have any proper background in coding, so you could say I'm a noob.
I would like to use data analytics through python and focus on crypto related stuff. Any help is appreciated!
